# Assignment 3: Knowledge Representation (Facts + Rules)

## What is Knowledge Representation?

Knowledge representation is a method used in Artificial Intelligence to store information in a structured way so that a computer system can reason about it.

It uses:
- Facts (stored knowledge)
- Rules (logical relationships)
- Inference (drawing new conclusions)

## What This Notebook Does

This notebook:

- Represents facts as (subject, relation, object)
- Uses rule-based inference to generate new facts
- Answers queries based on inferred knowledge
- Displays all inferred facts

## Logical Change Made

I added a new fact:
("David", "is_a", "Student")

This allows the system to infer additional knowledge.
